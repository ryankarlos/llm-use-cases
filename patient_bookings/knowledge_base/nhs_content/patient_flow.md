# NHS Patient Flow Guide

Based on NHS England's "Improving Patient Flow" guidance.

## What is Patient Flow?

Patient flow refers to how patients move through the healthcare system - from first contact to treatment completion. Good patient flow means:
- Shorter waiting times
- Better patient experience
- More efficient use of NHS resources

## Booking Process Flow

### Step 1: Initial Contact
Patient contacts the surgery via phone, online, or in person to request an appointment.

### Step 2: Triage
Reception or clinical staff assess urgency:
- Emergency: Immediate action (call 999)
- Urgent: Same-day appointment needed
- Routine: Standard booking within 1-2 weeks

### Step 3: Appointment Booking
Based on triage, an appropriate slot is offered considering:
- Patient preference
- Clinical need
- Available capacity

### Step 4: Confirmation
Patient receives confirmation via:
- Email
- SMS
- Letter (if requested)

### Step 5: Appointment
Patient attends appointment. If follow-up needed, process repeats.
